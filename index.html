        <p>
            <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you are visiting my website, then you are likely
            eager to learn more about me. I will start off by stating the obvious, my name
            is Noah Rose, and I am a University of Oregon graduate with a Bachelor of
            Science in Computer &amp; Information Science. Currently I am working at a
            student job that is ending very soon and I am looking to make a career out of
            software engineering. I have experience with a lot of different languages and
            tools thanks to the large variety of classes I learned from while earning my
            degree. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was also involved in a club known as the UO
            Makers Club. In this club we created a rover for the ARLISS rocketry event and
            later sought to teach students skills such as soldering and electrical
            engineering. Before I graduated, I became the Vice President of the club and
            assisted the President in recruitment and designing workshops for these new
            skills that we wanted to teach fellow students. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19
            we were unable to host anymore workshops and the club became inactive for the
            rest of my college career. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Outside of classes and extracurriculars I had a
            student job working at the Knight Library as a classroom technology technician
            and checkout assistant. In this position I helped teach instructors how to use
            equipment such as projectors and touch panels that were installed in
            classrooms. I also helped check equipment such as cameras and projectors out to
            students to assist with projects in their classes. I worked at this job for
            over two years but due to COVID-19 the office closed. <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With my experience in this role came an opportunity
            to continue working. When COVID-19 closed the office, I was one of the most
            experienced students left. For this reason, the design and engineering team
            requested that I come back to work for them. I gladly accepted their offer and
            assisted with installing new classroom equipment such as document cameras and
            web cameras to allow instructors to use these spaces for Zoom lectures.
            Currently I am working at this job and will continue working until December 11<sup>th</sup>
            as that is when I am no longer eligible to be hired as a student employee. <br>
