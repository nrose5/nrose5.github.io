        <h1>My Story</h1>
        <p>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for visiting my page! Chances are,
            you are interested in learning more about me. I will start by saying that I was a 
            born and raised Oregonian who had the pleasure of attending the University of
            Oregon where I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Computer and Information Science,
            along with a Minor in Mathematics.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; During my time at the University of Oregon I held a job at a
            help desk where we rented AV (Audio/Visual) equipment to faculty and staff for all of their 
            educational needs. We were also responsible for troubleshooting issues with classroom AV equipment
            including projectors, speakers, and the endpoints that the instructors connected to. As I grew and
            excelled in this role, I started learning more about classroom AV equipment installations. This led to
            opportunities where I could assist with these installations and learned more about the equipment that
            was used, such as digital media processors and audio processors. Eventually I reached the point where I
            was able to build and program a simple AV rack using Crestron's GUI-based language called SIMPL. Before
            I graduated and left this job we encountered a new obstacle in the AV world - COVID-19. Education institutions
            across the country were faced with a question they've never seen before - "How do we address the needs of
            students in a virtual environment while still utilizing the resources available in a traditional classroom?"
            This led to large installation efforts to support streaming capabilities in classrooms, and I am proud to
            claim to be an important part of those installations.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After I graduated, I wanted to pursue a career that closely aligned with Computer
            science, despite enjoying my time spent in the AV field. This led to me working as a Technical Support Engineer
            at Guidewire Software. In this role I had the unique experience of working on a completely remote environment,
            where a significant portion of my colleagues were working in Canada from the Toronto office. In this role I learned
            a lot about infrastructure design in SaaS platforms, as Guidewire's products rely on AWS for hosting and have
            interesting implementations using AWS. Although AWS is a large part of Guidewire's products, I gained 
            information in a wide range of areas. I gained expertise in utilizing SQL to fix inconsistent data in 
            our customers' databases. I learned how to develop workarounds for issues faced by customers in their implementations
            using Gosu - Guidewire's proprietary language similar to Java. I also learned about monitoring for infrastructure
            and application issues using tools such as SumoLogic and DataDog. I am grateful for the opportunities Guidewire
            has provided but I am always open for discussions. 
            <br><br>
